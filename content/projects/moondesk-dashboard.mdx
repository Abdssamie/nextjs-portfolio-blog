# Moondesk Dashboard

Moondesk is a modern dashboard application designed for managing IoT devices and visualizing real-time data. It provides a comprehensive solution for teams who need to monitor connected devices at scale.

## The Problem

Managing hundreds of IoT devices manually is time-consuming and error-prone. Teams need a centralized platform to:

- Monitor device status in real-time
- Analyze historical data patterns
- Manage user access and permissions
- Configure alerts and notifications

## The Solution

I built Moondesk as a full-stack solution that addresses these challenges with a focus on developer experience and scalability.

### Key Features

1. **Real-Time Updates**: WebSocket connections ensure data is always current without manual refreshes.

2. **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

3. **Dark Mode Support**: Reduces eye strain during extended monitoring sessions.

4. **Role-Based Access**: Granular permissions ensure team members only access what they need.

## Tech Stack

The application is built using modern technologies:

```typescript
// Example: Device monitoring hook
export function useDeviceStatus(deviceId: string) {
  const [status, setStatus] = useState<DeviceStatus | null>(null);
  
  useEffect(() => {
    const ws = new WebSocket(`wss://api.moondesk.com/devices/${deviceId}`);
    
    ws.onmessage = (event) => {
      setStatus(JSON.parse(event.data));
    };
    
    return () => ws.close();
  }, [deviceId]);
  
  return status;
}
```

### Architecture

- **Frontend**: Next.js 15 with App Router and React Server Components
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom design system
- **State Management**: React Query for server state, Zustand for client state
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM
- **Authentication**: NextAuth.js with multiple providers

## Results

Since launching Moondesk:

- **50% reduction** in device downtime through proactive monitoring
- **3x faster** issue resolution with real-time alerts
- **100+ devices** managed per instance without performance degradation

## What I Learned

Building Moondesk taught me valuable lessons about:

- Optimizing WebSocket connections for scale
- Designing intuitive data visualizations
- Implementing secure role-based access control
- Balancing feature richness with performance

## Future Plans

Upcoming features include:

- AI-powered anomaly detection
- Mobile app for on-the-go monitoring  
- Advanced reporting and export options
- Third-party integrations (Slack, Teams, PagerDuty)
