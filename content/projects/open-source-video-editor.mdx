# Open Source Video Editor

This project is a React + Remotion + AWS Lambda video editor MVP built from scratch. It allows users to create educational video templates or product showcase shorts for social media, with a focus on reusable JSON-based templates.

## Project Goals

The primary goal was to master full-stack complex state management and cloud rendering by building a tool that generates video content programmatically.

- **Frontend**: Next.js (App Router), React, Tailwind CSS
- **Video Engine**: Remotion
- **State Management**: Zustand
- **Cloud Infrastructure**: AWS Lambda

## Features

### 1. Timeline Interface
A robust timeline allows users to visualize tracks and items. Features include:
- **Drag & Drop**: Move items in time across different tracks.
- **Resizing**: Trim the start and end of video or audio clips.
- **Multi-track support**: Layer videos, images, and text.

### 2. Canvas Manipulation
The preview canvas supports direct manipulation of elements:
- **Move & Scale**: Position and resize elements directly on the video preview.
- **Real-time Preview**: Instant feedback using the Remotion Player.

### 3. Cloud Rendering
Decoupled rendering logic allows for high-performance video generation:
- **Headless Composition**: Logic separated from UI state for server-side rendering.
- **AWS Lambda**: Scalable parallel rendering using `@remotion/lambda`.

## Architecture

### Phase 1: Foundation
Initialized with Next.js App Router and configured the Remotion player. Established the basic layout with Tailwind CSS and set up Zustand for global state management.

### Phase 2: Core State
Designed a data model to track items (Video, Image, Text), their positions, and durations. Connected the Zustand store to the Remotion `<Player>` to drive the composition.

### Phase 3: Interactivity
Implemented complex interactions like drag-and-drop on the timeline and canvas manipulation. This involved calculating time-to-pixel ratios and handling various edge cases for smooth UX.

### Phase 4: Cloud Rendering
Set up the rendering pipeline. Created a Next.js API route to trigger renders via AWS Lambda, passing the JSON composition data to the headless renderer.

## Usage

The editor exports a JSON representation of the video, including all assets and text. This JSON can be stored and reused to generate new variations of the video programmatically, making it perfect for template-based content creation.
