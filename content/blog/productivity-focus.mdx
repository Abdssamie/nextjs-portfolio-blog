# Productivity & Recovering from Shiny Object Syndrome

We've all been there. You start a project, excited about the possibilities. Two days later, you see a tweet about a new library, and suddenly, rewriting your entire codebase seems like the most important thing to do.

This is **Shiny Object Syndrome**, and it kills shipping.

I am currently committed to recovering from this by building a rigorous system of organization and focus. Here is how I use my "Command Center" tools to stay on track.

## The Triad: Notion, Linear, GitHub

### 1. Notion: The Second Brain

Notion is where ideas go to gestate. It is not for task management; it is for knowledge management.
- **Documentation**: Project specs, research notes, and learning logs (like this blog!).
- **Vision**: Defining the "Why" before getting lost in the "How".

### 2. Linear: The Engine of Action

Once an idea is validated in Notion, it moves to Linear. Linear is, simply put, the best issue tracker I've ever used.
- **Cycles**: I work in 1-week cycles. If it's not in the cycle, it doesn't get done.
- **Triage**: Every random thought or bug report goes to Triage first. This keeps my immediate todo list clear of clutter.

### 3. GitHub: The Source of Truth

GitHub is where the work actually happens.
- **PRs as Milestones**: Every Pull Request is a discrete unit of value delivered.
- **CI/CD**: Automating tests and deployment removes the mental friction of releasing.

## The Mindset Shift

The tools are secondary to the mindset: **Commitment**.

When I start a project now, I define the stack and the scope upfront. I make a contract with myself that I will not switch tools halfway through unless there is a catastrophic blocker.

This focus has allowed me to go from "starting ten projects" to "finishing one". And in this industry, shipped code is the only code that counts.
