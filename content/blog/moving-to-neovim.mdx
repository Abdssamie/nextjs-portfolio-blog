# Why I Moved to Neovim (And Why You Should Too)

For the longest time, I was a dedicated VS Code user. It was the industry standard—rich ecosystem, great extensions, and it "just worked." I looked at Vim and Neovim users with a mix of awe and confusion. Why would anyone spend weeks configuring a text editor when VS Code works out of the box?

But recently, I made the switch. I moved from the comfort of VS Code (and even the Neovim extension inside it) to a full, standalone Neovim setup. And honestly? I'm not looking back.

If you've been hesitant to try Neovim because of the "steep learning curve" or the "configuration hell," I have good news: **Neovim in 2026 is a completely different beast.**

Here is why I moved, and why the arguments against it don't hold up anymore.

## 1. Easy Setup (The "Distro" Revolution)

The biggest myth about Neovim is that you need to be a Lua wizard to use it. "You'll spend more time configuring your editor than writing code," they say.

That might have been true five years ago. Today, we have **Neovim Distributions**.

Tools like **LazyVim**, **AstroNvim**, and **NvChad** give you a fully configured IDE experience in minutes. When I installed LazyVim, I didn't have to write a single line of config to get started. It came with:

- A beautiful theme
- File explorer (Neo-tree)
- Fuzzy finder (Telescope)
- Syntax highlighting (Treesitter)
- Status lines, git integration, and more.

It was literally: install Neovim, clone the starter repo, and run `nvim`. That's it. It’s as easy as installing VS Code and syncing your settings.

## 2. LSP Out of the Box

One of the main reasons I stuck with VS Code was the IntelliSense. I couldn't live without auto-completion, go-to-definition, and real-time error checking.

I was shocked to find that Neovim's LSP (Language Server Protocol) support is now **first-class**. In fact, it often feels *more* responsive than VS Code.

With modern setups, installing a language server is as simple as `:MasonInstall pyright` or `:MasonInstall gopls`. Most distros will even auto-detect the language you're working in and ask to install the LSP for you. You get the same diagnostics, the same refactoring tools, and the same type safety you're used to, but with a fraction of the resource usage.

## 3. True Vim Support

I used the Vim extension in VS Code for years. It was *okay*. But it was always an emulation. There were edge cases where it fought with VS Code's shortcuts, or certain motions just didn't work right.

Using standalone Neovim is like taking the weights off.

- **Global Marks** work flawlessly across projects.
- **Macros** are instantaneous and reliable.
- **Text Objects** (delete inside quotes, change around tags) become second nature.

It’s not just about keybindings; it’s about the **language of editing**. Once you are in a native environment, you can compose commands in ways that emulators just can't match. You stop thinking about "editing text" and start thinking about "transforming structures."

## 4. It is Blazingly Fast

This is the cliché, but it's true. VS Code is an Electron app. It’s a web browser running on your desktop. Even on a powerful machine, there is a perceptible millisecond delay when typing, opening files, or switching tabs.

Neovim is native. It starts in under 50ms. Opening a 10,000-line file is instant. Searching through a massive codebase with `Telescope` feels like magic compared to the sluggish search bar in many GUI editors.

This speed matters. It keeps you in the "flow state." When your tool moves as fast as your thought process, you stay focused on the problem, not the UI.

## Conclusion

Moving to Neovim wasn't about being an "elitist" developer. It was about finding a tool that respected my time and my workflow.

With the advent of modern distributions, the barrier to entry has crumbled. You get the **easy setup** of a modern IDE, the **LSP power** of VS Code, and the **speed and efficiency** of Vim.

If you're still on the fence, give **LazyVim** a try for a weekend. You might just find that the grass really is greener on the terminal side.
