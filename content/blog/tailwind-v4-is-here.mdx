# Tailwind CSS v4 is Here

Tailwind CSS v4 brings a completely rewritten engine and some exciting new features. Let's explore what's new.

## The New CSS Engine

Tailwind v4 introduces a new high-performance engine written from scratch. It's faster, smaller, and more powerful.

### Performance Improvements

- **10x faster** build times in development
- **Smaller CSS output** with better tree-shaking
- **Instant hot reloading** in dev mode

## New Features

### Native CSS Layers

Tailwind v4 uses native CSS `@layer` for better cascade control:

```css
@layer base {
  /* Base styles */
}

@layer components {
  /* Component styles */
}

@layer utilities {
  /* Utility styles */
}
```

### Container Queries

Built-in support for container queries without plugins:

```html
<div class="@container">
  <div class="@lg:flex @lg:gap-4">
    <!-- Responsive to container, not viewport -->
  </div>
</div>
```

### New Color System

The color palette has been expanded with OKLCH colors for better perceptual uniformity.

## Migration Guide

Upgrading from v3? Here's what you need to know:

1. Update your config file format
2. Review deprecated utilities
3. Test your existing styles

## Conclusion

Tailwind v4 is a significant upgrade that makes the framework faster and more capable. The new engine provides a solid foundation for future features.
