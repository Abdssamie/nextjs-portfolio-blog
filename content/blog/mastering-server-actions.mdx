# Mastering Server Actions in Next.js

Server Actions are one of the most powerful features in Next.js 14+. They allow you to run server-side code directly from your React components without creating separate API routes.

## What Are Server Actions?

Server Actions are asynchronous functions that execute on the server. They can be defined in Server Components or imported into Client Components, making data mutations seamless.

### Key Benefits

- **No API routes needed** - Define mutations inline with your components
- **Type safety** - Full TypeScript support end-to-end
- **Progressive enhancement** - Works without JavaScript enabled
- **Optimistic updates** - Built-in support for optimistic UI

## Creating Your First Server Action

Here's a simple example of a Server Action that adds a todo item:

```typescript
'use server'

export async function addTodo(formData: FormData) {
  const title = formData.get('title') as string
  
  await db.todos.create({
    data: { title }
  })
  
  revalidatePath('/todos')
}
```

## Using Server Actions in Forms

The most common use case is form submissions:

```tsx
import { addTodo } from './actions'

export function TodoForm() {
  return (
    <form action={addTodo}>
      <input name="title" placeholder="Add a todo..." />
      <button type="submit">Add</button>
    </form>
  )
}
```

## Best Practices

1. **Always validate input** - Never trust client data
2. **Use revalidation** - Keep your cache in sync
3. **Handle errors gracefully** - Return error states to the UI
4. **Consider optimistic updates** - Improve perceived performance

## Conclusion

Server Actions simplify data mutations in Next.js applications. They reduce boilerplate, improve type safety, and provide a better developer experience.

Start using them in your next project!
